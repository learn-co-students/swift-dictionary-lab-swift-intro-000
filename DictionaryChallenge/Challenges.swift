      MARK: 5)
      5. Create a function createPennsylvaniaSentence() which takes in no arguments. Its return type should be String. In your implementation you should call on the pennsylvaniaCapital() function you created in problem #4. Considering the return type of pennsylvaniaCapital() is an optional String (or String?), you should look to unwrap this value. If successful, you should use String Interpolation and generate the following sentence with this unwrapped value:
        "The capital of Pennsylvania is x." <-- x being the capital of Pennsylvania (don't forget the period).
       If you are unable to unwrap the value (in that it's nil), then you should return back the following String instead:
        "Unable to find the capital of Pennsylvania."

  /*
      MARK: 6)
      6. Create a function createAllStatesAndCapitals() which takes in no arguments. Its return type should be [String : String]. In your implementation, you should create a variable and assign it the value which is returned by a call to the createStatesAndCapitals() method. After doing that, add a new key-value pair to this new made dictionary variable you just created. The new key-value pair to add to this dictionary is the following:
            Pennsylvania - Harrisburg
          After creating this new key-value pair, you should return this dictionary.

  /*
      MARK: 8)
      8. Create a function createBand() which takes in no arguments. Its return type should be [String : [String]]. You might notice that the value (in the key-value description of a dictionary) of this particular return type is different than the others. The values contained in a dictionary can be of any type. Here, they are of type [String], an array of Strings and not just Strings as they were in the prior problems.
      In your implementation, you should look to first create three separate constants. Each constant should be an array representing the different members of the different bands. After doing so, you should create a dictionary where the keys represent the names of the bands and the values for those keys should be the array of band members that make up that band. After doing that, you should return this dictionary.
      Nirvana: Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, Dave Grohl
      The Beatles: John Lennon, George Harrison, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr
      The Breeders: Kim Deal, Kelley Deal, Josephine Wiggs, Jim Macpherson
